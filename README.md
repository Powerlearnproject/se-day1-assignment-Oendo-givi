#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
This is the art of applying engeneering principles and tools to create and maintain high quality softwares

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as fortan in 1957 laid the foundation for other programming languages.Additionally c was developed in 1972 by dennis ritchie.
Software engeneering as a faculty was established in the 1960s to lay ground for creation of complex systems
In 1970s structured programming was introduced with the aim of ensuring quality, clarity in developing softwares and assisted to reduce the complexity of software creation

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements; inlvolves collecting and documenting user needs and system requirement
Design-invloves creating a blue print that will outline  how a software will be built
Implementation-the developer writes the code and buld software according to the laid down blue print
Testing-Involves verifying that the software meets the standards and the specified requirements
Deployment- releasing the software to customers
Maintenance- providing continous upodates to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall model provides a linear sequential approach whereby on phase of project has to be done before moving to the next phase therefore the project is completed  first before testing begins while agile methodology emphasizes the need for incremental approach to a project allowing for flexibility,collaboration and customer feedback for instance the customer will request  for a login page provides feedback before proceeding to other pages


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:design software based on set requirements and write efficient codes that is maintanable
Quality Assurance Engineer:responsible for creating test plans,test case and scripts based on software demands and design documents
 Project Manager:Responsible for overseeing the planning ,implementation and delivery of software projects by creating detailed timelines,milestones providing resources andbudgeting.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) offer tools for code editing,debugging and project management for instance pycharm, visual studio code and eclipse on the other hand Version Control Systems (VCS) allow developers to track and manage changes to source code in addition to allowing delevopers to work collaboratively on the same projects and examples include Git and subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements: sometimes rquirements can be vague or incomplete leading to frustrations therefore using agile methodologies will ensure changes can be accomoddated
Tight deadlines: limited timelines sometimes makes developers make shortcuts thus affecting quality of work,this therefore can be mitigated by working with stakeholders to prioritize features and deliver most important first
Technical debt:this is as a result of suboptimal solutions which henceforth will result in high costs in maintaining the code,this challenge can be countered by prioritizing refactoring and doing regular code reviews thus will prevent debt from growing to unmanageable levels

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UnitTesting is used to test individual components of  code and it is useful in early bug detection,enhancing code quality and serve  as a form of documentation
Integration Testing focuses on testing the interaction of different units in a software and aims to detect interface issues and catching errors,verifying subsystems ensuring that they work properly
System Testing involves testing complete and fully intergrated software and assist to validate end to end behavior of a software ensuring that all components work in harmony
Acceptance Testing is done to ensure whether the software meet the requirements and is ready for deployment
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering the art of crafting questions to get the best responses from AI model  hence this assist  in enhancing AI output quality and maximising AI capabilities

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: translate this "niko njaa"
Effective:Translate this  swahili statement to english; this statement is effective because it adds context
